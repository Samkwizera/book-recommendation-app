# Challenges Faced and Solutions
Deployment Environment Differences

Challenge: Server A and Server B used slightly different environments, causing some dependencies to break.

Solution: Used Docker containers to ensure consistent environments. Additionally, set up environment-specific configuration files to handle unique deployment requirements.
